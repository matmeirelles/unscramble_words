# Game - Unscrable de words

App developed during the Navigation module from Google Developer courses.

## How does it work

- You have 10 scrambled words that you should unscramble
- You can try as many time as you want, but if you still aren't able to solve it you can skip a word
- Every time that you get the right answer you will win 20 scores
- In the end, let's see how much score you can get? =)
